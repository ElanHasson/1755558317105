Define “DevOps tax” in one sentence.\n- Ask for a quick show of hands: who’s burned time on YAML/SSL/secrets this month?\n- Emphasize impact on velocity and morale for small teams.\n- Transition: promise of PaaS with concrete outcomes (speed, reliability, cost predictability).\n- Name-drop key App Platform features succinctly: repo connect, buildpacks/Docker, SSL, autoscale, rollback, metrics, managed DBs.\n- Keep it under 60 seconds and set expectation for the demo/deeper dive next.",
      "narration": "If you’re on a small team, you’ve probably felt the DevOps tax... It’s that constant pull away from building features into maintaining pipelines, wrangling YAML, renewing SSL, tuning autoscaling, wiring logs and alerts, and praying rollbacks work at 2 a.m... The cost is real: slower releases, on-call fatigue, and bills that are hard to predict.\n\nA Platform-as-a-Service changes that curve... With DigitalOcean’s App Platform, you push code from your repo and the platform handles the rest: buildpacks or Docker, zero-downtime deploys, built-in SSL, autoscaling, health checks, metrics, and one-click rollbacks... You also get managed databases, storage, CDN, domains, and secure env vars without stitching tools together—plus pricing that makes sense for lean teams.\n\nIn the next minutes, I’ll show you exactly how App Platform removes most of that DevOps toil so you can ship faster and sleep better.",

      "narration": "Let’s peek under the hood of App Platform and see how it removes the day-to-day DevOps pain... The high-level flow is simple: you push to Git, App Platform builds your app into a container, deploys it behind a managed load balancer, and scales it based on your settings—without you touching Kubernetes, registries, or SSL.\n\nFirst, the build phase... When you connect a GitHub or GitLab repo and push a commit, App Platform pulls the code and decides how to build it... If you don’t have a Dockerfile, it uses Cloud Native Buildpacks to detect your language and runtime—Node, Python, Go, Ruby, Java, PHP, and more—then produces an optimized container image... It caches dependencies so subsequent builds are much faster, and it injects environment variables and build secrets securely... If you prefer full control, include a Dockerfile or point to a prebuilt image in DigitalOcean Container Registry or Docker Hub... App Platform will use exactly what you provide.\n\nNext, deploy... The platform provisions your app instances, applies your configuration, and runs health checks... Only when the new version is healthy does traffic switch over, so you get zero-downtime rollouts... If anything goes wrong, it automatically rolls back, and you can trigger a manual rollback with one click... It also handles the messy parts: HTTPS and automatic certificates via Let’s Encrypt, custom domains, HTTP over modern protocols, and a global CDN for static assets... For safe testing, every pull request can spin up a deploy preview that mirrors production.\n\nFinally, scale... You can scale vertically by picking the instance size—more CPU and memory—or horizontally by increasing the instance count... For unpredictable traffic, enable autoscaling within the min and max you set, and App Platform will add or remove instances to keep things responsive... Logs and metrics are built in, so you can see deploy status, request rates, and errors without wiring up extra infrastructure... And when you need stateful services, you can attach managed databases and queues that integrate cleanly with your app.\n\nIn short, the workflow is Git to buildpacks or Docker to deploy to scale, with health-checked, zero-downtime releases and instant rollback... You focus on code and configuration; App Platform handles the containerization, infrastructure, and operations behind the scenes.",

      "narration": "In the next two minutes, I’ll deploy a complete setup on DigitalOcean’s App Platform: a web service, a background worker, and a one-time database migration that runs before anything goes live—all driven by a single App Spec.\n\nHere’s the spec... It defines three components... First, the web service, sourced from the web directory, with a route on slash and a simple npm start... Second, a worker that runs node worker dot js for background jobs... Third, a pre-deploy job called migrate dash db... This is the key: it runs our database migrations before the platform starts the web and worker, so a bad migration never reaches production.\n\nLet’s deploy it from the CLI... I’ll run doctl apps create with the spec... The output returns an App ID, so I’ll save that and list the deployment... Now I’ll tail the migration logs... You’ll see a small build phase followed by the run phase where our migrations execute... If this step fails, App Platform automatically stops the rollout and nothing breaks in production.\n\nWith migrations successful, the platform starts the web service and the worker... I’ll switch to the web component logs, and you can see the application booting... The worker comes up the same way and begins processing background tasks.\n\nThat’s it: a full, ordered deployment from one file and one command, with logs, health checks, and deploy-on-push handled for us... Secrets and database URLs can be managed in the App Platform UI, so you don’t need extra CI scripts or server setup... This is how you remove DevOps pain: declare what you want, and let the platform do the rest.",

      "narration": "Let’s make your app production‑ready in minutes by leaning on App Platform’s managed foundations and a few best practices... First, security... App Platform gives you managed HTTPS and TLS out of the box... Flip on Enforce HTTPS so traffic is always encrypted... Keep credentials out of code by using encrypted environment variables, and connect to Managed Databases over private networking inside your VPC... Limit exposure to just HTTP and HTTPS at the edge, and only enable preview environments for trusted branches, then clean them up after review.\n\nFor CI and CD, connect your GitHub or GitLab repository and deploy from your protected main branch... Turn on preview deployments for pull requests so every change gets its own staging URL for tests and QA before merge... Use buildpacks if you want zero‑config builds, or bring your Dockerfile for full control—but keep images minimal and pin your versions... Add a simple health check endpoint, like slash health‑z, so rolling updates verify readiness before shifting traffic... If something goes wrong, you can roll back to a previous deployment with a click.\n\nOn cost control, start small on the Basic tier and right‑size from real metrics... Set minimum and maximum instances so autoscaling handles spikes but never runs away... Serve your frontend as a Static Site backed by the CDN, and offload persistent state to a Managed Database... Regularly prune preview deployments and unused components, and set billing alerts so there are no surprises.\n\nThe sample spec on screen shows the essentials: deploy on push from main, two instances for resilience, a health check for safe rollouts, and a secret for runtime... With that, you’ve got security, CI and CD, and cost controls baked in—removing the usual DevOps pain while staying in the driver’s seat.",
